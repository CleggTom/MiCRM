MiCRM.jl relies heavily on the brilliant DifferentialEquations.jl to do the numerical integration and it is worth having a look at the docs to get an idea of what is going on under the hood in your simulations. The simulation procedure is fairly straightforward and just requires that we first create an ODEProblem object which defines the problem for the ODE solver and then solve it with the aptly named solve function.
